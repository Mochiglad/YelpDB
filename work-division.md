Both Partners worked on the representation of the database, Evan primarily worked on the algorithms and the structured queries. Steven primarily worked on the Multithreaded Server and simple queries.

Stage 1:
	Both partners discussed the design of the representation. Steven Created the Generic Objects, as well as the Yelp Objects. Evan cleaned them up. 5 hours was spent on this stage. 
	
Stage 2:
	Evan completed both the K-means clustering algorithm and the Prediction methods and created the test cases, while Steven ran a few more test cases to ensure correctness. 10 hours went into this stage.
	
Stage 3:
    Steven created the multithreaded server from the provided FibonacciServer code. About 1 hour went into this stage.
    
Stage 4:
	Steven created a method to allow for clients to pass in requests with regards to the database. These requests include the operations GETRESTAURANT, ADDRESTAURANT, ADDREVIEW, ADDUSER. Steven also added support for Structural queries via requests, which was created by Evan. About 12 hours was spent on this stage.
	
Stage 5:
	Evan created the grammar, syntax, and methods for the Structured Queries. About 9 hours went into this stage.
